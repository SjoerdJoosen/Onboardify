# Welcome to Onboardify
This is the back-end application for TaxModel Onboarding gamification

## Project goal
In collaboration with TaxModel this project aims to digitalize and gamify an Onboarding process.
Since most of this onboarding process was being done manually by someone who would be better off spending their time on other things. Our goal was to make a fun and interactive onboarding system that introduces a new collague to the company.

This project could be scaled up in the future so it could be used for several different companies. Since this project is a long term pilot transferability is all the more important.
